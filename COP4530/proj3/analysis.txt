Implimentation:
	I decided to use STL list to impliment my Stack<T>
	Within each lists' node, there are basically two pointers referencing to the previous and next nodes

Complexity Analysis:
	Stack<T>::clear() member function is really just using the member function of stl list<T>::clear(). Therefore, the run-time analysis of Stack<T> is equal to std list<T>
	So not only does the current node need to be deleted, but also the adjacent 2 nodes,*prev and *next
	Time complexity is a constant O(1).
