I have the first pass done pretty well
The labels are stored with the addresses and the LA instructio is converted to the LUI and SLL instructions
	with the appropriate information being shared between the two.

What I do not have completed is the second pass.
I am able to convert the registers to their decimal equivalents, but not the label matching, nor the memory
	storing or loading.
